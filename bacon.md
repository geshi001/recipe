# How to Cook Bacon

## Ingredients
+ Bacon slices

## Steps
1. Find a non-stick pan. 
2. You don't really need to preheat the pan. 
3. Put bacon slices on the pan and let them cook. 
4. You will see fat coming out. Don't worry.
5. Your bacon should be crispy in a few minutes. Say, 3 to 4 minutes. I will do a quantitive research someday to find a good timing. 
6. Wipe out the pan with paper towels. This is IMPORTANT: you don't want to wash your pan after the fat solidifies. If it did solidify, you would like to reheat the pan until the fat melts. 
7. Enjoy your bacon!
